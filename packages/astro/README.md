# @heydeacon/astro

Adds the [Deacon](https://heydeacon.com) chat widget to every page of an Astro site. For Starlight docs, use [@heydeacon/starlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heydeacon/starlight) instead.

Deacon is an AI support agent that answers questions from your own docs and content, and says when it doesn't know.

You need a Deacon account, and there's a free plan.

## Install

```sh
npm install @heydeacon/astro
```

## Set it up

Add the integration to `astro.config.mjs` with your key:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import deacon from '@heydeacon/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [deacon({ key: 'pk_your_widget_key' })],
});
```

To find your key, open Install from the button at the top of the Deacon dashboard. The snippet there has it in `data-key`, and it starts with `pk_`. If the key is missing, or an option has the wrong type, the build stops and says why.

Deacon only runs on the sites listed on Install. A listed domain covers its subdomains, so `example.com` covers `docs.example.com`. If your site lives somewhere else, such as `example.netlify.app`, add that address on Install too.

When you run `npm run dev`, Install notices the widget on `localhost:4321` and lets you add it in one click. Chats on localhost don't count towards your plan.

## Options

| Option      | Type    | Default  | What it does |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `key`       | string  | required | Your Deacon key. |
| `context`   | object  | none     | Details about the visitor that Deacon takes into account when it answers, the same on every page, such as `{ docsVersion: '3.2' }` for the version of the docs they're reading. Up to 12 keys, each value a string, number or boolean. Anyone can read them in the page's HTML, so never put a secret here. |
| `pageViews` | boolean | `true`   | The same script counts visits for Deacon's website analytics. Set this to `false` to send no page views or JavaScript errors from your site. Chat still works. |

```js
deacon({
  key: 'pk_your_widget_key',
  context: { docsVersion: '3.2' },
  pageViews: false,
});
```

## Opening the chat from your own button

The widget comes with its own button. To use one of yours instead, hide Deacon's in Appearance in the dashboard and call `window.Deacon.open()` from your button or link. `Deacon.close()` and `Deacon.toggle()` work too.

## What it adds

A small script in the head of every page adds the same tag Install gives you:

```html
<script src="https://heydeacon.com/widget/v1/loader.js" data-key="pk_your_widget_key" async></script>
```

It loads in the background without holding up the page. If your site uses view transitions (`<ClientRouter />`), the widget stays in place as people move between pages, and an open chat stays open.

Works with Astro 5 and later.
